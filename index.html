      <p>My name is Erica Catherine Piano. I was born January 14, 1992 and live in New Jersey.</p>

      <p>I have my Bachelors Degree in Psychology from Penn State University and work full time as a substance abuse counselor for Rutgers University Behavioral Healthcare.</p>

      <p>I am currently in school part time at Rutgers University. I am taking a Web Development bootcamp, and have hopes doing a career and becoming a full stack web developer. In my free time I enjoy doing Zumba, going to concerts with my friends, practicing meditation, and watching reality tv.</p>
